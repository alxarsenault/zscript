      <p>
        {{zname}} borrows most of its syntax from C, and C++, but it has also been influenced by JavaScript.
        {{zname}} is {{bold "case-sensitive"}} and uses the UTF-8 character set. For example, this {{zscript-intext-code "φΩψλω∮da∑∀∈"}} could be used as a variable name.
      </p>

      <p>
        In {{zname}}, instructions are called statements and are separated by semicolons (;).
        A semicolon is not necessary after a statement if it is written on its own line.
        But if more than one statement on a line is desired, then they must be separated by semicolons.
      </p>

      <p>
        It is considered best practice, however, to always write a semicolon after a statement, even when it is not strictly needed.
        This practice reduces the chances of bugs getting into the code.
      </p>

      <p>
        The source text of {{zname}} script gets scanned from left to right, and is converted into a sequence of input elements which are tokens, control characters, line terminators, comments, or whitespace. (Spaces, tabs, and newline characters are considered whitespace.)
