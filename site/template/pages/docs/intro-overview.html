        <p>
          <span class="zscript-name-in-text">ZScript</span> is a modern, dynamically typed scripting language designed for flexibility, ease of use, and
          powerful runtime
          features.
          It offers a hybrid type system, combining the best of both weak and strong typing, giving developers the
          freedom to
          choose between dynamic flexibility
          and static type safety when needed.

        <div class="zscript-para">
          <span class="zscript-name-in-text">ZScript</span> is inspired by several well-known scripting languages but introduces unique elements that make it
          adaptable
          to various use cases, from rapid prototyping to more structured application development.
          Its simple syntax and diverse set of features make it suitable for tasks ranging
          from simple scripts to complex systems with performance requirements.

        <h2 class="zscript-page-sub-title"><span class="zscript-page-sub-title-num">1.1.1.&nbsp;</span>Key Features</h2>

        <ul class="zscript-list">
          <li>
            <span class="zscript-list-label">Hybrid Typing System:</span>
            <span class="zscript-name-in-text">ZScript</span> allows variables to be declared either <strong>weakly</strong> typed or <strong>strongly</strong>
            typed,
            offering the flexibility of dynamic
            typing while enabling stricter type enforcement where necessary.
            Developers can choose to rely on weak typing for rapid development and experimentation or enforce strong
            typing to
            prevent errors and ensure predictable behavior.

            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Weak Typing:</strong>
                Variables declared with the var keyword can hold values of any type and can be reassigned to different
                types
                throughout their lifetime.
              </li>
              <li><strong>Strong Typing:</strong>
                Variables can be declared with explicit types like <code>int, float, or string</code>. Once
                declared, they are restricted to those types, preventing accidental type errors.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="zscript-list-label">Type Inference and Auto Typing:</span>
            <span class="zscript-name-in-text">ZScript</span> introduces an auto keyword that automatically infers the type of a variable based on its initial
            value. This
            combines the flexibility of dynamic
            typing with the safety of strong typing, without requiring the developer to explicitly specify the type.
          </li>

          <li>
            <span class="zscript-list-label">Type Restrictions:</span>
            Developers can restrict variables to specific sets of types. For example, a variable can be declared to
            only accept
            <code>int</code>
            or <code>float</code>, providing both flexibility and control. <span class="zscript-name-in-text">ZScript</span> also includes convenient shortcuts,
            like the
            <code>number</code> keyword,
            which is equivalent to <code>var&lt;int, float&gt;</code>, simplifying code while maintaining type
            restrictions.
          </li>

          <li>
            <span class="zscript-list-label">Constant Variables:</span>
            Immutability is supported through the <code>const</code> keyword, allowing developers to define constant
            values that
            cannot be
            changed after initialization. This is useful for defining configuration values, constants, or any data
            that should
            remain fixed throughout the execution of a script. <span class="zscript-name-in-text">ZScript</span> enforces that constant variables be initialized
            with
            literal values, enhancing performance and predictability.
          </li>

          <li>
            <span class="zscript-list-label">Global Variables:</span>
            <span class="zscript-name-in-text">ZScript</span> supports global variables, which can be declared and accessed from anywhere within a script. By
            using the
            <code>global</code> keyword, developers can clearly indicate that a variable is intended to be globally
            accessible,
            ensuring
            clarity and avoiding accidental overwrites of local variables.
          </li>

          <li>
            <span class="zscript-list-label">Simple and Powerful Syntax:</span>
            <span class="zscript-name-in-text">ZScript</span> has a clean and intuitive syntax that lowers the barrier to entry while still providing powerful
            features
            for experienced developers. The language offers constructs like arrays, tables (dictionaries), functions,
            classes,
            and instances, making it versatile and capable of handling complex scenarios.
          </li>

          <li>
            <span class="zscript-list-label">Extendability and Interoperability:</span>
            With types like <code>user_data</code> and <code>raw_pointer</code>, <span class="zscript-name-in-text">ZScript</span> is designed to interact with
            external
            systems and libraries,
            making it suitable for embedding in larger applications, game engines, or systems that need customizable
            scripting
            capabilities. This enables integration with C/C++ libraries and other environments.
          </li>
        </ul>



        <h2 class="zscript-page-sub-title"><span class="zscript-page-sub-title-num">1.1.2.&nbsp;</span>Why ZScript?</h2>
        <p>
          The primary motivation behind <span class="zscript-name-in-text">ZScript</span> is to provide developers with a language that strikes a balance
          between dynamic
          flexibility and static reliability. Many modern scripting languages, while powerful, either impose too much
          structure or
          too little, leaving developers to choose between type safety and ease of use. <span class="zscript-name-in-text">ZScript</span>’s hybrid approach
          allows
          developers to move fluidly between the two extremes as needed.
        </p>
        <ul class="zscript-list">
          <li>
            <span class="zscript-list-label">Flexibility for Beginners:</span> Beginners can start with weak typing
            and basic constructs
            without worrying
            about strict rules, while gradually adopting more advanced features as they become comfortable.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="zscript-list-label">Power for Experts:</span> Advanced users can take full advantage of the
            strong typing system, type
            inference,
            and type restrictions to write efficient, safe, and maintainable code, especially in larger projects or
            performance-critical applications.
          </li>
        </ul>

            rewrite
            or recompile the entire system.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="zscript-list-label">Prototyping:</span> <span class="zscript-name-in-text">ZScript</span>’s weak typing and flexible syntax make it
            ideal for rapid prototyping, allowing
            developers to experiment with ideas and features quickly before committing to more structured code.
          </li>
          <li>
