        <p>
          A comment is text that the compiler ignores but that is useful for programmers.
          Comments are normally used to embed annotations in the code. The compiler treats them as white space.
          The syntax of comments is the same as in C++ and in many other languages:
        </p>

        <h4> Single line comment  </h4>
        <p>
          A comment can be {{zscript-intext-code "//"}} (two slashes) characters, followed by any sequence of characters.

          {{#code-block label="Single line comment"}}
  // This is a single line comment.
  const a = 55; // This is also a single line comment.
  /// And that too.{{/code-block}}
        </p>

        <h4>Multi-line comment</h4>
        <p>
          A comment can also be {{zscript-intext-code "/*"}} (slash, asterisk) characters,
          followed by any sequence of characters (including new lines), followed by the {{zscript-intext-code "*/"}} characters.
          This syntax is the same as ANSI C.

          {{#code-block label="Multi-line comment"}}/*
  * This is a multi-line comment.
  * Keeps going.
  */{{/code-block}}

          You can't nest block comments.
          This often happens when you accidentally include a {{zscript-intext-code "/*"}} sequence in your comment,
          which will terminate the comment.

          {{#error-code-block label="Multi-line comment error"}}/* You can't, however, /* nest comments */ SyntaxError */{{/error-code-block}}
        </p>

        <h4>Inplace comment</h4>
        <p>
          {{#code-block label="Inplace comment"}}
var a = /* comment */ 55;{{/code-block}}
        </p>
