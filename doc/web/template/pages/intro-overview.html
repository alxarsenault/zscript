          <h2>1.1. Overview</h2>
          <p>
            ZSCRIPT is a modern, dynamically typed scripting language designed for flexibility, ease of use, and
            powerful runtime
            features.
            It offers a hybrid type system, combining the best of both weak and strong typing, giving developers the
            freedom to
            choose between dynamic flexibility
            and static type safety when needed.
          </p>
          <div class="zscript-para">
            ZSCRIPT is inspired by several well-known scripting languages but introduces unique elements that make it
            adaptable
            to various use cases, from rapid prototyping to more structured application development.
            Its simple syntax and diverse set of features make it suitable for tasks ranging
            from simple scripts to complex systems with performance requirements.

          <h3>Key Features</h3>

          <ul class="zscript-list">
            <li>
              <span class="zscript-list-label">Hybrid Typing System:</span>
              ZSCRIPT allows variables to be declared either <strong>weakly</strong> typed or <strong>strongly</strong>
              typed,
              offering the flexibility of dynamic
              typing while enabling stricter type enforcement where necessary.
              Developers can choose to rely on weak typing for rapid development and experimentation or enforce strong
              typing to
              prevent errors and ensure predictable behavior.

              <ul>
                <li>
                  <strong>Weak Typing:</strong>
                  Variables declared with the var keyword can hold values of any type and can be reassigned to different
                  types
                  throughout their lifetime.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Strong Typing:</strong>
                  Variables can be declared with explicit types like <code>int, float, or string</code>. Once
                  declared, they are restricted to those types, preventing accidental type errors.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              <span class="zscript-list-label">Type Inference and Auto Typing:</span>
              ZSCRIPT introduces an auto keyword that automatically infers the type of a variable based on its initial
              value. This
              combines the flexibility of dynamic
              typing with the safety of strong typing, without requiring the developer to explicitly specify the type.
            </li>

            <li>
              <span class="zscript-list-label">Type Restrictions:</span>
              Developers can restrict variables to specific sets of types. For example, a variable can be declared to
              only accept
              <code>int</code>
              or <code>float</code>, providing both flexibility and control. ZSCRIPT also includes convenient shortcuts,
              like the
              <code>number</code> keyword,
              which is equivalent to <code>var&lt;int, float&gt;</code>, simplifying code while maintaining type
              restrictions.
            </li>

            <li>
              <span class="zscript-list-label">Constant Variables:</span>
              Immutability is supported through the <code>const</code> keyword, allowing developers to define constant
              values that
              cannot be
              changed after initialization. This is useful for defining configuration values, constants, or any data
              that should
              remain fixed throughout the execution of a script. ZSCRIPT enforces that constant variables be initialized
              with
              literal values, enhancing performance and predictability.
            </li>

            <li>
              <span class="zscript-list-label">Global Variables:</span>
              ZSCRIPT supports global variables, which can be declared and accessed from anywhere within a script. By
              using the
              <code>global</code> keyword, developers can clearly indicate that a variable is intended to be globally
              accessible,
              ensuring
              clarity and avoiding accidental overwrites of local variables.
            </li>

            <li>
              <span class="zscript-list-label">Simple and Powerful Syntax:</span>
              ZSCRIPT has a clean and intuitive syntax that lowers the barrier to entry while still providing powerful
              features
              for experienced developers. The language offers constructs like arrays, tables (dictionaries), functions,
              classes,
              and instances, making it versatile and capable of handling complex scenarios.
            </li>

            <li>
              <span class="zscript-list-label">Extendability and Interoperability:</span>
              With types like <code>user_data</code> and <code>raw_pointer</code>, ZSCRIPT is designed to interact with
              external
              systems and libraries,
              making it suitable for embedding in larger applications, game engines, or systems that need customizable
              scripting
              capabilities. This enables integration with C/C++ libraries and other environments.
            </li>
          </ul>



          <h3>Why ZSCRIPT?</h3>
          <p>
            The primary motivation behind ZSCRIPT is to provide developers with a language that strikes a balance
            between dynamic
            flexibility and static reliability. Many modern scripting languages, while powerful, either impose too much
            structure or
            too little, leaving developers to choose between type safety and ease of use. ZSCRIPT’s hybrid approach
            allows
            developers to move fluidly between the two extremes as needed.
          </p>
          <ul class="zscript-list">
            <li>
              <span class="zscript-list-label">Flexibility for Beginners:</span> Beginners can start with weak typing
              and basic constructs
              without worrying
              about strict rules, while gradually adopting more advanced features as they become comfortable.
            </li>
            <li>
              <span class="zscript-list-label">Power for Experts:</span> Advanced users can take full advantage of the
              strong typing system, type
              inference,
              and type restrictions to write efficient, safe, and maintainable code, especially in larger projects or
              performance-critical applications.
            </li>
          </ul>

              or recompile the entire system.
            </li>
            <li>
              <span class="zscript-list-label">Prototyping:</span> ZSCRIPT’s weak typing and flexible syntax make it
              ideal for rapid prototyping, allowing
              developers to experiment with ideas and features quickly before committing to more structured code.
            </li>
            <li>
              <span class="zscript-list-label">Tooling and Automation:</span> ZSCRIPT can be used for scripting tools,
              automating workflows, or creating
              small applications that require a combination of flexibility and power. Its mix of dynamic and strong
              typing
              enables quick iteration while maintaining reliability where needed.
