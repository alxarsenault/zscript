ZSCRIPT is designed to be highly adaptable to a wide range of use cases, including but not limited to:
<ul>
  <li>
    <h4>Game Scripting:</h4> The language’s hybrid typing system allows for the fast-paced, iterative development
    cycles required in game scripting. ZSCRIPT’s support for arrays, tables, and user-defined classes make it an
    excellent choice for game logic, AI behaviors, and event handling.
  </li>
  <li>
    <h4>Embedded Systems:</h4> With its lightweight footprint and dynamic nature, ZSCRIPT can be embedded into
    larger applications, providing a scripting interface for customization or automation without needing to rewrite
    or recompile the entire system.
  </li>
  <li>
    <h4>Prototyping:</h4> ZSCRIPT’s weak typing and flexible syntax make it ideal for rapid prototyping, allowing
    developers to experiment with ideas and features quickly before committing to more structured code.
  </li>
  <li>
    <h4>Tooling and Automation:</h4> ZSCRIPT can be used for scripting tools, automating workflows, or creating
    small applications that require a combination of flexibility and power. Its mix of dynamic and strong typing
    enables quick iteration while maintaining reliability where needed.
