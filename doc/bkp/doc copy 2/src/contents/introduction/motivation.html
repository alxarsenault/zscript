The primary motivation behind ZSCRIPT is to provide developers with a language that strikes a balance between dynamic
flexibility and static reliability. Many modern scripting languages, while powerful, either impose too much structure or
too little, leaving developers to choose between type safety and ease of use. ZSCRIPTâ€™s hybrid approach allows
developers to move fluidly between the two extremes as needed.

<ul>
	<li>
		<h4>Flexibility for Beginners:</h4> Beginners can start with weak typing and basic constructs without worrying
		about strict rules, while gradually adopting more advanced features as they become comfortable.
	</li>
	<li>
		<h4>Power for Experts:</h4> Advanced users can take full advantage of the strong typing system, type inference,
		and type restrictions to write efficient, safe, and maintainable code, especially in larger projects or
		performance-critical applications.
