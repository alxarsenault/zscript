    <h4 class="zscript-list-label">1. Hybrid Typing System:</h4>
    ZSCRIPT allows variables to be declared either <strong>weakly</strong> typed or <strong>strongly</strong> typed,
    offering the flexibility of dynamic
    typing while enabling stricter type enforcement where necessary.
    Developers can choose to rely on weak typing for rapid development and experimentation or enforce strong typing to
    prevent errors and ensure predictable behavior.

    <ul >
      <li>
        <strong>Weak Typing:</strong>
        Variables declared with the var keyword can hold values of any type and can be reassigned to different types
        throughout their lifetime.
      </li>
      <li><strong>Strong Typing:</strong>
        Variables can be declared with explicit types like <code>int, float, or string</code>. Once
        declared, they are restricted to those types, preventing accidental type errors.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h4 class="zscript-list-label">2. Type Inference and Auto Typing:</h4>
    ZSCRIPT introduces an auto keyword that automatically infers the type of a variable based on its initial value. This
    combines the flexibility of dynamic
    typing with the safety of strong typing, without requiring the developer to explicitly specify the type.
  </li>

  <li>
    <h4 class="zscript-list-label">3. Type Restrictions:</h4>
    Developers can restrict variables to specific sets of types. For example, a variable can be declared to only accept
    <code>int</code>
    or <code>float</code>, providing both flexibility and control. ZSCRIPT also includes convenient shortcuts, like the
    <code>number</code> keyword,
    which is equivalent to <code>var&ltint, float&gt</code>, simplifying code while maintaining type restrictions.
  </li>

  <li>
    <h4 class="zscript-list-label">4. Constant Variables:</h4>
    Immutability is supported through the <code>const</code> keyword, allowing developers to define constant values that
    cannot be
    changed after initialization. This is useful for defining configuration values, constants, or any data that should
    remain fixed throughout the execution of a script. ZSCRIPT enforces that constant variables be initialized with
    literal values, enhancing performance and predictability.
  </li>

  <li>
    <h4 class="zscript-list-label">5. Global Variables:</h4>
    ZSCRIPT supports global variables, which can be declared and accessed from anywhere within a script. By using the
    <code>global</code> keyword, developers can clearly indicate that a variable is intended to be globally accessible,
    ensuring
    clarity and avoiding accidental overwrites of local variables.
  </li>

  <li>
    <h4 class="zscript-list-label">6. Simple and Powerful Syntax:</h4>
    ZSCRIPT has a clean and intuitive syntax that lowers the barrier to entry while still providing powerful features
    for experienced developers. The language offers constructs like arrays, tables (dictionaries), functions, classes,
    and instances, making it versatile and capable of handling complex scenarios.
  </li>

  <li>
    <h4 class="zscript-list-label">7. Extendability and Interoperability:</h4>
    With types like <code>user_data</code> and <code>raw_pointer</code>, ZSCRIPT is designed to interact with external
    systems and libraries,
    making it suitable for embedding in larger applications, game engines, or systems that need customizable scripting
    capabilities. This enables integration with C/C++ libraries and other environments.
